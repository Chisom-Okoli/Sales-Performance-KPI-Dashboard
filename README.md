# Sales-Performance-KPI-Dashboard (Power BI)
Power BI sales performance dashboard analyzing revenue growth, product mix, customer concentration, and regional trends using DAX-driven KPIs.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales performance data to evaluate key business KPIs such as revenue, sales growth, product performance, and regional trends. The goal is to provide stakeholders with an interactive dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making and performance monitoring.
The dashboard is designed for sales managers and business leaders to quickly identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement.

## Problem Statement 
The business needs a clear, centralized view to understand the key drivers of sales performance and revenue growth across products, customers, regions, and time.

## Project Objectives
The objective of this project is to 
- Measure overall sales performance using key KPIs
- Identify top-performing and underperforming products
- Analyze regional sales trends
- Track sales growth over time
- Support strategic decisions related to pricing, inventory, and sales focus

  
## The dashboard aims to:
- Identify whether revenue growth is driven by pricing or sales volume
- Highlight top-performing products and customer segments
- Analyze regional demand and market concentration
- Track sales performance trends over time to support data-driven decision-making

## Project Description

This project involves the development of an interactive **Power BI sales performance dashboard** designed to analyze revenue trends, sales volume, product performance, customer behavior, and geographical distribution. The objective was to move beyond basic reporting and identify the key drivers of business growth.

The analysis revealed **$105M in total revenue with 16.1% year-on-year growth**, driven primarily by increased sales volume rather than pricing changes. Product-level insights highlighted cartons and cans as the highest-performing categories by quantity, while customer analysis showed revenue concentration among a small group of high-value customers. Geographical insights indicated strong demand across Asian markets, with consistent performance in selected European regions.

This project demonstrates the application of **Power BI, KPI analysis, data modeling, and business-oriented data storytelling** to transform raw data into actionable insights that support informed decision-making.

## DAX Measures & Calculations

The dashboard leverages DAX measures to ensure accurate KPI computation, time-based comparisons, and dynamic filtering.

### Core Measures
- **Total Revenue**: Calculates total sales value across all transactions.
- **Total Quantity Sold**: Aggregates total units sold.
- **Average Unit Price**: Derives pricing stability by dividing revenue by quantity.
- **Year-on-Year Growth (%)**: Measures annual performance changes using time intelligence functions.
- **Top Customers Contribution**: Identifies revenue concentration among high-value customers.

### DAX Techniques Used
- `CALCULATE()` for context modification  
- `SUM()` and `DIVIDE()` for accurate aggregations  
- Time intelligence functions such as `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR()`  
- Filter context management for dynamic visuals
  
## Skills Demonstrated
- KPI design and performance analysis  
- DAX-based measure development  
- Data storytelling and dashboard design  
- Translating business questions into analytical insights  

  
## Key Insights
- Certain products consistently generate higher revenue and drive overall performance
- Sales performance varies significantly across regions, indicating opportunities for targeted strategies
- Seasonal trends affect revenue, suggesting the need for demand forecasting and planning

## Recommendations
- Increase focus and marketing spend on top-performing products
- Develop targeted sales strategies for underperforming regions
