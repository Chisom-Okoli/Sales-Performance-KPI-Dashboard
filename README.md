# Sales-Performance-KPI-Dashboard (Power BI)
Power BI sales performance dashboard analyzing revenue growth, product mix, customer concentration, and regional trends using DAX-driven KPIs.

## Problem Statement 
The business needs a clear, centralized view to understand the key drivers of sales performance and revenue growth across products, customers, regions, and time.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that provides a consolidated view of sales performance by analyzing revenue trends, sales volume, product mix, customer concentration, and geographical distribution.

The dashboard aims to:
- Identify whether revenue growth is driven by pricing or sales volume
- Highlight top-performing products and customer segments
- Analyze regional demand and market concentration
- Track sales performance trends over time to support data-driven decision-making

## Project Description

This project involves the development of an interactive **Power BI sales performance dashboard** designed to analyze revenue trends, sales volume, product performance, customer behavior, and geographical distribution. The objective was to move beyond basic reporting and identify the key drivers of business growth.

The analysis revealed **$105M in total revenue with 16.1% year-on-year growth**, driven primarily by increased sales volume rather than pricing changes. Product-level insights highlighted cartons and cans as the highest-performing categories by quantity, while customer analysis showed revenue concentration among a small group of high-value customers. Geographical insights indicated strong demand across Asian markets, with consistent performance in selected European regions.

This project demonstrates the application of **Power BI, KPI analysis, data modeling, and business-oriented data storytelling** to transform raw data into actionable insights that support informed decision-making.

## Key Insights
- $105M total revenue with 16.1% YoY growth  
- Growth driven by increased sales volume rather than pricing changes  
- Cartons and cans identified as top-performing product categories  
- Revenue concentration among high-value customers  
- Strong demand across Asian markets with steady European performance  

## DAX Measures & Calculations

The dashboard leverages DAX measures to ensure accurate KPI computation, time-based comparisons, and dynamic filtering.

### Core Measures
- **Total Revenue**: Calculates total sales value across all transactions.
- **Total Quantity Sold**: Aggregates total units sold.
- **Average Unit Price**: Derives pricing stability by dividing revenue by quantity.
- **Year-on-Year Growth (%)**: Measures annual performance changes using time intelligence functions.
- **Top Customers Contribution**: Identifies revenue concentration among high-value customers.

### DAX Techniques Used
- `CALCULATE()` for context modification  
- `SUM()` and `DIVIDE()` for accurate aggregations  
- Time intelligence functions such as `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR()`  
- Filter context management for dynamic visuals
